## What is video data in education?

* audiovisual recordings 
* captured within educational settings (primarily classrooms)
* for the purpose of conducting scientific research [@Corti.2000; @Andersson.Sorvik.2013]

* What are we talking about when it comes to "video data" in education?
* ...
* ...
* This could onclude videos of counseling sessions with school psychologists or parent-teacher talks
* for us, and for the purpose of this presentation, this mainly refers to **classroom videos**

* Now the camera setup for these studies can vary considerably between studies, resulting in different numbers of videos and image content
* on the left side you'll see a very classical setup with two cameras one focusing the teacher (filming from the back) and one focusing the students (filming from front)
* but there are also other setups with a multitude of cameras and microphones resulting in a very different video data collection and therefore different needs when sharing data

#### Diverse research designs

Depending on the research interest, e.g.

* longitudinally observe one group/teacher [@Syring.etal.2023]
* cross-section over specific subject & grade [@Gruenkorn.etal.2020]

\

#### Connected with other data sources

`r fontawesome::fa("square-poll-vertical")` Student survey<br /><br />
`r fontawesome::fa("comments")` Teacher survey/interview

* And the research interest determines not only the camera setup, but also who is filmed and how often

## Why is video data powerful?

::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}
**1. direct observation**  
grants insights into processes and practices of learning and instruction  
\


**2. high degree of richness/complexity**  

* spoken word, intonation, modulation
* facial expressions, gestures, postures
* positioning and orientation in the room
* temporal sequence and simultaneity of events
* ...

  

**3. allows for nuanced evaluations**  
repeating or manipulating (vs. in situ observation)

::: {.notes}
* So why am I advocating for video data in general? The answer from research on teaching and teacher quality would be: Because it is a powerful data source to investigate learning.
* it **complements** product oriented measures (such as assessments) and allows us to **actually observe** processes and practices of learning while it happens
* it transports a high degree of richness, by making it able to observe what is said and what is done **in which way**, but also what is NOT said
* and compared to "in situ" observation, video obviously is at an advantage, because it allows us to pay detailed attention to a multitude of these aspects within the complex interactions in the classroom
