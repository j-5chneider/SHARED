## What is video data in education?

* Now the camera setup for these studies can vary considerably between studies, resulting in different numbers of videos and image content
* on the left side you'll see a very classical setup with two cameras one focusing the teacher (filming from the back) and one focusing the students (filming from front)
* but there are also other setups with a multitude of cameras and microphones resulting in a very different video data collection and therefore different needs when sharing data

* longitudinally observe one group/teacher [@Syring.etal.2023]

* So why am I advocating for video data in general? The answer from research on teaching and teacher quality would be: Because it is a powerful data source to investigate learning.
* it **complements** product oriented measures (such as assessments) and allows us to **actually observe** processes and practices of learning while it happens
* it transports a high degree of richness, by making it able to observe what is said and what is done **in which way**, but also what is NOT said
* and compared to "in situ" observation, video obviously is at an advantage, because it allows us to pay detailed attention to a multitude of these aspects within the complex interactions in the classroom

:::
::: {.column width="45%"}
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
* Against this background, investigating how to best share quality video data for reuse is particularly desirable
* As we saw before: There are standards for data sharing: If we want to optimize data sharing for reuse, making data FAIR is a central framework to follow
:::

## ShaReD

**Findable**  
![](www/fair1.jpg){width="100%"}

::: {.notes}
* How do we make video data FAIR?
* Compared to log data, we already have a pretty good idea of which recommendations can be made and which standards and templates can be used.
* These are not equally detailed for all areas, but there are usually at least initial approaches
* For example: If you want to make your classroom videos findable for reuse, the ideal option would be to provide it to a RDC.
* You would provide your videos in a package together with several other documents, such as a description of the camera setup and the context of the study.
* The RDC will also ask you to provide metadata about your videos. Metadata are descriptions about what others would be able to find in your data. For example "grade level", "school subject", "angle of the camera", ...

:::


## ShaReD
**Findable**  
![](www/fair2.jpg){width="100%"}

::: {.notes}
* RDCs then offer a user interface where people interested in reusing video data can search for suitable videos
* Looking through every video would be way too time consuming
* So RDC need the metadata, descriptions of the videos, to make the data searchable and therefore findable
:::

## ShaReD
**Accessible**  
![](www/fair3.jpg){width="100%"}

::: {.notes}
* Are videos usually directly accessible for the public?
* Usually no. But what makes video data fair is to clearly state under which conditions interested people may reuse the data.
* For many classroom videos, this condition is the use of the videos for research purposes paired with a certain qualification level (PhD student)
:::


## ShaReD
**Interoperable**  
![](www/fair4.jpg){width="100%"}

::: {.notes}
* Making video data interoperable, meaning others can open and manipulate the file, can be achieved by adhering to certain file format conventions
* these are usually defined by the RDC
:::

## ShaReD
**Reusable**  
![](www/fair5.jpg){width="100%"}

::: {.notes}
* So researchers *found* your data, they were able to *access* and *open* it.
* But they can only meaningfully reuse the video data if they understand what the context of the data collection is
* The interpretation of video data may depend, for example, on whether the usual teacher delivered the lesson or whether a teacher was randomly assigned for the study
* So if researchers provide a methods report, for example simply by linking it to a journal paper 
* and if they additionally provide a short field report that, for example specifies the camera setup
* there are good conditions for reuse.
:::


## [Project phases & focus areas]{.splash-slide-text} {.center}

* But, we wouldn't be doing a project on sharing and reusing research data, if there are no challenges
* The takeup of sharing as well as reusing classroom videos is somewhat slow, I will show you some numbers in a second

## [Next steps]{.splash-slide-text} {.center}



## Next steps
\
\

* Guideline on "Repository or research data center?"<br /><br /><br />
* Expanding the availability of videos (strategy needed)<br /><br /><br />
* pilot projects: Automated evaluation of classroom videos


::: {.notes}

* Concerning the next steps we are complementing the available resources at the RDC
* One of the questions that is still challenging to judge for researchers is: When is my data suitable for reuse at a research data center and when does is make more sense to "only" archive data? Turns out, a guideline on this question is more challenging than I initially anticipated. For example it is hard to pin down the analysis potential of videos in order to answer this question.
* We are also currently trying to expand the availability of classroom videos on the RDC. We do that by establishing contact with authors from video studies. This, however, is going quite slow. We need to establish a strategy, otherwise I don't see this move forward.
* We are also considering pilot projects in the automatic analysis of video data. Like in Daniels project, we are trying to explore possibilities and examples that may inspire further research.

* In both projects we are working on "how to make research data FAIR"
* What is different, is that in our respective fields there are currently different challenges laying ahead
* For log data it is sill unclear on how we can document data so that others understand and are able to reuse
* So Daniel for example works on pilot projects that explore possibilities for FAIR documentation and the question if we can derive more general recommendations from these

---

* Whereas with video data, the current challenge is to investigate where are the barriers and facilitators to video data sharing
* we apply rather a meta-view on the research ecosystem and try to locate barriers and prerequisites
